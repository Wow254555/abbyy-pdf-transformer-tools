Overview
abbyy-pdf-transformer-tools is a set of utilities built around ABBYY PDF Transformer capabilities. It focuses on creating PDFs from source data, converting between formats, recognizing form data, and applying security controls. The project aims to provide dependable, well-documented commands and libraries that fit into everyday workflows. The design favors clarity, predictable results, and straightforward configuration. It suits developers, data engineers, and business teams who need repeatable PDF automation without vendor lock.

What this tool is for
- Create PDFs from structured data sources, templates, or receipts of digital information.
- Convert PDFs to other formats such as Word, Excel, or plain text, preserving layout where possible.
- Extract form fields from digitized documents and convert them into structured data for downstream processing.
- Apply security to PDFs, including encryption, password protection, and permission sets.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines, batch jobs, and server environments to automate document workflows.

Core features
- High-fidelity PDF creation: templates, styles, and embedded resources render consistently across platforms.
- Flexible conversion: preserve layout, fonts, and metadata when converting to common formats.
- Form recognition: robust extraction of text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and signatures.
- Security controls: encryption, access permissions, digital rights management basics, and audit logging.
- Command-line and programmatic access: easy to embed into scripts, workflows, and apps.
- Cross-platform compatibility: runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux with consistent behavior.
- Lightweight dependencies: minimal footprint, faster startup, and easier maintenance.
- Extensible architecture: plug in adapters for new data sources and targets.

How it works
- A tooling core accepts an input document, a transformation plan (templates, rules, or pipelines), and a target for output.
- The plan guides how content is parsed, formatted, and written into the target file format.
- For form recognition, a recognition model or rule set maps fields to structured data.
- For security tasks, metadata and encryption settings are applied during finalization.
- The process is designed to be deterministic: same inputs should produce the same outputs, with optional variation control via configuration.
- Logging provides traceability from input to output, including any errors in the pipeline.

Quick start
- Prerequisites: a modern runtime (the project ships with a bundled runtime when appropriate), a supported OS, and access to the Releases artifacts for initial setup.
- Typical flow: install the tool, prepare a transformation plan or template, provide the input source, run the process, review the output, and adjust as needed.
- Basic usage pattern: run a command with input, transform, and output options. See the examples section for common patterns.

Install and run
- On Windows:
  - Download the latest release artifact from the Releases page (see Release artifacts and downloads). Run the installer to set up the tool on your system.
  - After installation, you can run the command-line utility from a terminal:
    - abbyy-pdf-transformer-tools --input path\to\input.pdf --template path\to\template.json --output path\to\output.pdf
  - If you need to run in a headless server, create a batch script that invokes the tool with your default configuration.

- On macOS:
  - Obtain the release artifact from the Releases page and install as instructed by the installer package.
  - Use the CLI similarly to Windows:
    - abbyy-pdf-transformer-tools --input /Users/you/input.pdf --template /Users/you/template.json --output /Users/you/output.pdf

- On Linux:
  - Download the Linux artifact from the Release page and extract it to a working directory.
  - Ensure the runtime dependencies are present (the package manager can install missing libraries).
  - Execute using the CLI:
    - ./abbyy-pdf-transformer-tools --input /home/user/input.pdf --template /home/user/template.json --output /home/user/output.pdf

- Quick verification:
  - Run a dry run to validate the plan without writing output:
    - abbyy-pdf-transformer-tools --input sample.pdf --template sample-template.json --output /tmp/dry-run.pdf --dry-run
  - Check the logs for any warnings or errors; adjust templates or rules as needed.

- Typical command structure:
  - --input: path to the source document or directory containing documents.
  - --template: path to a transformation template or rules file.
  - --output: path to the resulting file or directory for batch results.
  - --mode: optional mode selector (creation, conversion, recognition, or security).
  - --log-level: debug, info, warning, error.

- Configuring templates and rules:
  - Templates define how content is laid out in the output, including fonts, margins, and pages.
  - Rules specify how to map source content to output fields, including form fields for recognition tasks.
  - Templates and rules can be authored in JSON or YAML formats, depending on the release.

- Example workflow:
  - Prepare a data source with structured data for a set of invoices.
  - Create a PDF invoice template that defines branding and header/footer.
  - Use the tool to generate PDFs for all invoices, applying the template and capturing key fields (invoice number, date, total).
  - Run a conversion pass to extract data to CSV or JSON for analytics.

Release artifacts and downloads
